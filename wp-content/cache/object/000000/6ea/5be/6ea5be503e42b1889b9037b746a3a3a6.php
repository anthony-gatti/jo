<blockquote>My name is JOSEPHINE LEUNG and I'm a <span>passionate</span> Digital Designer</blockquote>


<p>

I'm a creative, passionate and ambitious digital designer who loves all things about fashion &amp; design. After starting my career designing websites for various fashion retailers, I've worked for all kinds of companies from start ups to established fashion brands, from small business to corporate giants. I've gained experience designing across multi-channel. Whether it's tablet, mobile, websites or print. I've got an excellent eye for imagery, typography and layout and also a great understanding of the importance of user experience. I'm capable in producing highly conceptual designs as well as developing on brand, pixel perfect online marketing materials. I thrive for success and have the ability to adapt quickly to changing priorities.
