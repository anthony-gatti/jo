I knew could spend the time to write a little script to export my database and pass it along to another storage location, but then I thought of BackupBuddy from iThemes. 5 minutes later I had BackupBuddy installed, with a nightly job configured to do a full export of my database and store the last 10 days of backups in my Dropbox account. Sure, I could have written the code to do this myself. It’s always tempting to do-it-yourself when you know you can do something. The key is to ask yourself if you should do something. It would have taken much more than 5 minutes to get even a simple backup script written and configured; and I definitely wouldn’t have had the storage and and automation options that BackupBuddy provides out of the box. If you need hassle-free backups for your self-hosted WordPress site1, give BackupBuddy a try.     If you have a website, please make sure you have an automated backup system, and that you’ve tested your backups to make sure they actually work. ↩   '>Alex King: In Praise of BackupBuddy</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://ma.tt/2015/03/live-in-the-moment/' title='Jenna Wortham writes on Trying to Live in the Moment (and Not on the Phone).
